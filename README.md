Clear saved data after the update
If you donâ€™t care about older sessions or are still testing, you can just clear old data:
1. Go to training_storage and uncomment clearTrainingHistory()
2. Go to main.dart and replace void main() with this code 
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await TrainingStorage.clearTrainingHistory();
  runApp(BoxingTimerApp());
}
